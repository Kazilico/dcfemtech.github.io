    “This awards program was conceptualized to focus exclusively on the DC region’s women engineers and programmers - as opposed to awards that recognize women
    working in non-technical roles at technology companies,” said Shana Glenzer, VP of Social Marketing at SocialRadar and co-organizer of DCFemTech. “We are
    excited to celebrate these accomplished women who are making significant contributions to their organizations and who are unsung heroes in our ecosystem.”
</p>
<p>
    Based on the number and high quality of nominations that were received, the awards program may expand to include other technology disciplines in 2016.
