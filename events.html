            <p><strong>The Road Forward // Bridging the Digital Divide in the Nation's Capital</strong></p>
            <p>Saturday 9/22 from 9am-12:30pm at The Washington Post</p>
            <p>Access to the Internet has changed the way we communicate, work, learn, access essential services, and get our news and information. Yet, approximately 150,000 District households are not connected to broadband Internet. Those who don’t have access to the Internet, don't know how to use it, or don’t see why it’s important are at a great disadvantage in an increasingly digital age. Fortunately, we’re witnessing the growing movement of changemakers who are working collaboratively across public, private and nonprofit sectors to solve this local challenge. How can we close the gap between the “haves” and “have nots” in the District of Columbia? Meet the people and organizations at the center of this work, learn where we’ve been and where we’re headed and contribute to a dynamic discussion about what works.
