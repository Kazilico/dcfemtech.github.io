                <p>Code & Coffees are hosted bi-weekly. BYO-Projects and laptops for a fun, informal way to learn, code and work on projects with other members in the community. No project? No problem. We have tons of resources to get you started on something. From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS, these events are open to all. Feel free to come early or stay later. Beginners welcome.
                </br>
                Code & Coffees are sponsored by @DCfemtech, @WomenWhoCodeDC, @LadiesWhoCode DC, @RailsGirlsDC, @GirlDevelopItDC and @PyLadiesDC. Check out their individual pages for more events throughout the month.</p>
