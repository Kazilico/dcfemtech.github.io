  <h1>DCFemTech Hack For Good</h1>
  <p>We are holding our first formal (but, really <em>informal</em>) hackathon! Join other developers (and some designers) in giving back to our local community.</p>

  <p>Hack for Good is a two day event bringing folks together to work on projects that support our community. Progress on projects will be presented in a science fair format at the conclusion of the event. This is a different kind of hackathon. No competition, no award money; just bringing people together to learn, make connections, and build something awesome! We will be hacking at LivingSocial's inspiring new space. Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
